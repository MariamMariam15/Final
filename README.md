## Automated Testing for Login and forgot Password Functionality using Selenium in Java
## Introduction
This project aims to automate the testing of the login forgot password functionality of a web application using Selenium WebDriver in Java. The automated tests will simulate user interactions with the login page, enter valid and invalid credentials, and verify the expected outcomes
## Setup and Installation
To set up and run the automated tests, follow these steps:
1. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2023.1.
2. Install Selenium WebDriver and its dependencies. You can use a build tool like allure-TestNG, TestNG, maven and web driver manager
3. Download the appropriate WebDriver executable for your target browser (e.g., ChromeDriver ).
4. Configure the system's PATH variable to include the directory where the WebDriver executable is located, or specify the WebDriver path programmatically in your test code.
5. Clone this repository to your local machine.
## Test Scenarios
The login functionality is tested with the following scenarios:
1. Valid credentials: Enter the correct username and password and verify successful login.
2. Invalid credentials: Enter the incorrect username and/or password and verify appropriate error message is displayed.
3. Forgot password: Verify the "Forgot Password" functionality by resetting the password through email.
## Testing Framework
This project utilizes TestNG as the testing framework.TestNG provides a set of annotations for writing test methods and assertions to validate the expected results.
